This repo is demonstrating the below SOLID principles with code example to understand in details with example
SOLID design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible software. Consequently, as our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity and save ourselves a lot of code/design hurdles in future.
The following 5 concepts make up our SOLID principles:
1.	Single Responsibility
2.	Open/Closed
3.	Liskov Substitution
4.	Interface Segregation
